## What is ZfcDatagrid?

[ZfcDatagrid](https://github.com/zfc-datagrid/zfc-datagrid/) is a datagrid or datatable module for 
[Laminas](https://www.getlaminas.org/), it can handle multiple data sources like 
[Doctrine2](http://www.doctrine-project.org/), 
Laminas\Db and PHP Array, and may output to multiple formats also like [jqGrid](http://www.trirand.com), 
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/),  CLI, PDF and Excel... and others.

So to clarify, ZfcDatagrid is NOT a CRUD abstraction, it's here to read data from different sources and display it in different output formats
